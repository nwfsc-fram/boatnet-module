Lost Gear

Lost pots

When a pot is lost, the discard is calculated as the average weight of catch (both discarded and retained)
from all other pots in the string. This calculation is automated.

Other lost gear

Discards for any other type of lost gear are calculated manually and therefore these debits may appear
later in the Vessel Accounting System than other debits. The specific calculation depends on the type of
gear lost, but the general goal is to estimate based on the catch (both retained and discarded) from
similar hauls or trips. For example, a lost string of pots is calculated as the average catch from other
pots on that trip multiplied by the number of pots on the lost string. A lost trawl net would be
calculated based on the catch per hour of towing for other hauls on the same trip multiplied by the
hours the lost net was towed.
