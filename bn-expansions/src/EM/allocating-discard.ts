Allocating discards from unidentified or mixed species groups

Non-selective Discards

Non-selective discards are primarily unintentional discards in the whiting fleet (e.g. net bleeds). Nonselective
discards are reported in both EM and in logbooks. Because the catch composition of these
discards is assumed to be similar to the overall catch, the discard weight is apportioned based on the
ratio of pounds landed per species on the fish ticket.

Example:
    o Vessel has 1000 pounds of non-selective discards
    o Fish ticket shows they landed 90K lbs whiting, 5K lbs widow, and 5K lbs shortbelly rockfish
    o Calculated EM discard is 900lbs whiting and 50 lbs widow. Shortbelly is not an IFQ species so
    there is no debit for the remaining 50 lbs.

Selective Discards

Selective discards are allowed based on the rules set out for each vessel in their Vessel Monitoring Plan.
Selective discards should always be reported to species in the logbook. In EM, selective discards are
generally identified to species, however some fish can only be identified to a group level (e.g. mixed
rockfish or mixed thornyheads). In these cases, the discard weight is apportioned among IFQ categories
based on the ratio of fish from that group in the logbook.

Example:
    o Logbook reports 5 pounds Dover Sole and 5 pounds English Sole discards
    o EM reports 20 pounds Unidentified Flatfish discards
    o EM discards are split 50 %Dover/50% English per the logbook ratio
    o Final EM record is 10 pounds Dover Sole and 10 pounds English Sole discards

Whenever possible, the logbook ratio from the same trip is used, however if no species from that group
were reported in that logbook, a ratio from all trips from that vessel or from that fleet in the previous
year is used.

See Appendix C for additional details on the allocation of discards from unidentified or mixed species
groups.
